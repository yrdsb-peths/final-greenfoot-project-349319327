##final project

This game is a simple boss fight, shoot the boss while not getting hit, the boss has 2 phases, phase 1 with basic attacks, and phase 2 adds a laser. The player can only shoot in one direction and cannot aim the gun. Movement keys are w(up), a(left), s(down), d(right) and right click to shoot. Defeating the boss hitless will result in a new message on the victory screen.
